#Comment on the difference between the planned schedule, and the "real" one

#Steps for generating Effort, Development Time and Person required for different KLOC values for Basic Model
#Step 1: Generating Random Integers between 2 and 741 for KLOC
#Step 2: Determining the type of models based of KLOC value by using IF ELSE statements
#Step 3: Determing values of Effort, Development Time and Person required by subsituting values for each type of models, using IF ELSE statements

#Time consumed to producing generate testing for different KLOC = 30 minutes (real)
#Time planned = 35 minutes


| **Scheduled Time** | **Real Time** | 
| --------------- | --------------- |
|From COCOMO model, the estimated time for our project is 4.2 months and the number of persons required is 1  | Total time taken by 4 of us is 15 hours 35 minutes|
