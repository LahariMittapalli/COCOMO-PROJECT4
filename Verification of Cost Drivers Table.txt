We verify the correctness of cost drivers table by using our program: CompareCostDrivers.java
We acquired the tableWeb data from https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/software-engineering-cocomo-model/ and tablePaper data from “Boehm, B.W., 1984. Software engineering economics. IEEE transactions on Software Engineering, (1), pp.4-21.”
The result given by the program is False.
